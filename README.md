# Poly-Forgery
> _Thank Mojang for Custom Fonts_

A serverside Fabric mod that restores [Alloy Forgery's](https://github.com/LordDeatHunter/Alloy-Forgery) Forge Controller GUI when using it with [PolyMC](https://github.com/TheEpicBlock/PolyMc) _(kinda)_.

## Why would you need this?
If you host a server using [PolyMC](https://github.com/TheEpicBlock/PolyMc) modded UIs won't be displayed correctly (or straight up won't work sometimes); this mod imitates the [Alloy Forgery's](https://github.com/LordDeatHunter/Alloy-Forgery) Forge Controller GUI via [PolyMC](https://github.com/TheEpicBlock/PolyMc), even for Vanilla clients ([POLYMC](https://github.com/TheEpicBlock/PolyMc) / [POLYMER](https://github.com/Patbox/polymer) - GENERATED RESOURCE PACK REQUIRED).
